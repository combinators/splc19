variants are the SPL frameworks supported by the most extensive commercial case-studies in our list. A feature they
share with CLS is support for domain spaces with non-boolean types (e.g., numbers), which can also be automatically
computed. This exceeds the capabilities of feature diagrams, where extensions have been proposed to include numbers for
modeling cardinalities .\cite{Sousa:2016:EFM:2934466.2934475}. In our example, variable cardinalities are used to model
the different numbers of piles in a
 game and positions for their layout are automatically computed. Inclusion of non- booleans blows up
 the order of magnitude of possible products from 2n , where n is the number of decisions to be made, to infinity.
