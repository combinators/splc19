In our approach, all product line family modeling is accomplished in the application domain model space and the
 combinators are written to simply “materialize” the actual solution-domain code that reflects the application
 domain model. This work will also enable true independence from underlying technologies and external
 dependencies, and in particular, address the common problem of upgrading code that depends upon a framework
 that has evolved.
