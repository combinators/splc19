\begin{abstract}
Object-oriented (OO) frameworks represent a significant achievement in extensible design,
but there are many well-documented challenges when third-party programmers attempt to use and
refactor them. In earlier work, we described how to migrate existing OO framework- based software
into a software product line structure using combinatory logic synthesis (CLS) integrated into FeatureIDE,
an Eclipse-based IDE that supports feature-oriented software development. While initially successful at
synthesizing a few instances of a product line, the approach does not scale to support larger product
lines because it does not adequately capture the commonality and inherent variability in the application domain.
In this paper, we analyze these problems, and introduce our new approach to construct product line which
overcomes many drawbacks of old approach. We describe how application domain modeling helps automated
composition, and how our redesigned CLS-engine improves scalability. Results are illustrated by scaling
the well-known graph product line with our approach, while reducing the average amount of instance-specific
code significantly, generating more readable code and providing more convenience for refactoring.

\section{Acknowledgments}

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment section, which is placed just before the reference section in your document. 

This section has a special environment:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{acks}
  ...
  \end{acks}
\end{verbatim}
so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure consistency in the spelling of the section heading. 

Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

\section{Appendices}

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the ``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source document. 

Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \appendix
\end{verbatim}
and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section and subsection identification method.

\section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in the margin:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\verb|sidebar|}:  Place formatted text in the margin.
\item {\verb|marginfigure|}: Place a figure in the margin.
\item {\verb|margintable|}: Place a table in the margin.
\end{itemize}

%
% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures
% the proper identification of the section in the article metadata, and the consistent spelling of the heading.
\begin{acks}
To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
\end{acks}

% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and the bibliography file.
